We found visual attributes of object classes can be unsuperisedly learned by applying Independent Component Analysis on the softmax outputs of a trained ConvNet. We showed such attributes can be useful for object recognition by performing zero-shot learning experiments on the ImageNet dataset of over 20,000 object classes.<br>
